# Twitter Data Analysis Project

This project contains a Google Colab script for analyzing Twitter data.

## Project objectives
The goal of this work is to examine the structure of communication on the Twitter social network by applying the method of network data analysis, in order to determine whether the observed network shows the characteristics of an organic public discussion or patterns that may indicate coordinated behavior.

## Used libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run the script:
* `pandas` - for working with tables
* `matplotlib` or `seaborn` - for graphs
* `numpy` - for mathematical operations
* `NetworkX` - for network analysis
* `PyVis` - for network visualization
